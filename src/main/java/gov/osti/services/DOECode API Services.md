DOECode Services
==================

#### Introduction
Description of services provided by the API back end of DOECode.  The HTTP `GET` verb is used to retrieve information in various desired formats, and the `POST` verb used to send new and updated metadata information to the persistence back end.

> The API is available via requests sent to `/doecode/services/` on the DOECode server.

#### HTTP Request Methods
| Method | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `GET` | Used to retrieve resources |
| `POST` | Create or update resources |
| `PUT` | *Not currently used* |
| `DELETE` | *Not currently used* |

#### Metadata Service Endpoints
`GET` /services/metadata/{codeId}
> Retrieve the metadata by its *{codeId}* value.  Values returned as single JSON Objects.  See [metadata example below.](#json_example)
```json 
{ "metadata" : 
  { "software_title" : "Sample Data", "code_id": 234 ... } 
}
```

`GET` /services/metadata/yaml/{codeId}
> Retrieve the indicated metadata by its *{codeId}* value, in YAML format.

`GET` /services/metadata/autopopulate?repo={url}
> Attempt to read information from the given *repository URL* value.  Supports github.com, bitbucket.org, and sourceforge.com. Any relevant information from the repository API will be returned as metadata JSON Objects.

`POST` /services/metadata
> Send JSON metadata to be persisted in the back-end.  This service persists the data in the *Saved* work-flow state.

`POST` /services/metadata/publish
> Send JSON metadata to be persisted in the *Published* work-flow state.  Validation on required metadata fields is performed, and any errors preventing this operation will be returned.
